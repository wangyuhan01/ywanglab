        <p>The lab employs modern systems neuroscience tools, such as large-scale 2-photon calcium imaging, to investigate the neural basis of learning and cognitive map formation in rodents. We also use insights gained from studying the brain to inspire the development of novel AI algorithms that can reason using naturally formed internal world models, bridging the gap between biological and artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the lab engages in software and hardware engineering to develop custom tools that support and streamline their research efforts. By combining cutting-edge neuroscience techniques, innovative AI algorithms, and purpose-built engineering solutions, the lab aims to advance our understanding of intelligence and push the boundaries of what is possible in both biological and artificial systems.</p>
